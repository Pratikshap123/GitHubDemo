        Purpose of the git pull origin branchname command
        The git pull origin branchname generally tells the git to pull / fetch (projects and data) from the remote repo named origin to our branchname ,
        illustrated in the figure below.

    <p>
        To answer your question, the
        git pull origin master will pull changes from the origin remote, master branch and merge them to the locally checked-out branch. However,
        the git pull origin/master will pull changes from the locally stored branch origin/master and merge that to the local checked-out branch. 
        The origin/master branch is nothing but a "cached copy" of what was last pulled from origin, which is why it's called a remote branch in the git parlance. 
        This can be interpreted as being somewhat confusing but nevertheless, you can see what branches are available with git branch and git branch -r to see the 
        "remote branches".
